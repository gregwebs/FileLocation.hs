Description: 
    Common debugging\/error\/exception functions that give file location information
    .
    @
    $(err \"OH NO!\")
       
    main:Main main.hs:16:1 OH NO!
    @
    .
    Notice how it displays package:module file:line:character
    .
    It exposes the functions err (error), undef (undefined), and trc (Debug.Trace.trace). All of these behave the same as their normal counterpart but also spit out a location.
    .
    Here is my favorite helper, debug, which is like trace but just show the value.
    .
    @
    debug [1,2,3]
    
    DEBUG: [1,2,3]
    [1,2,3]
    @
    .
    And The Template Haskell version.
    .
    @
    $(dbg) [1,2,3]
    
    DEBUG main:Main main.hs:1:3 [1,2,3]
    [1,2,3]
    @
    .
    Also there is a version of thrwIO that gives location information
    .
    @
    ($(thrwIO) $ AException) `catch` \e -> putStrLn (\"Caught \" ++ show (e :: AException))
    
    Caught AException \"main:Main test/main.hs:25:6\"
    @
    .
    See module for a listing of all the functions with short descriptions, and the homepage for some more examples https://github.com/gregwebs/ErrorLocation.hs
